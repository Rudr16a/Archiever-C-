- **Progress Tracking**: Track user progress towards achievements.
- **Persistence**: Save and load achievement data to/from files.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend and customize the functionality to fit your needs.
- **Event-Driven**: React to events within your application to update achievements.

## Requirements

- **C++11 or higher**: This project uses modern C++ features.
- **CMake**: For building the project.
- **A C++ Compiler**: Such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC.

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/achiever.git
cd achiever
```

### Building the Project

1. Create a build directory:

   cd build
   ```

2. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

### Including the Library

Include the Achiever header in your project:

```cpp
#include "achiever.h"
```

### Creating Achievements

Define achievements by creating instances of the `Achievement` class:

```cpp
Achievement firstWin("First Win", "Win your first game.", 100);
Achievement collector("Collector", "Collect 100 items.", 200);
```

### Tracking Progress

Update the progress of achievements based on events in your application:

```cpp
firstWin.incrementProgress();
collector.incrementProgress(10);
```

### Saving and Loading

Save the current state of achievements:

```cpp
AchievementManager::save("achievements.dat");
```

Load achievements from a file:

```cpp
AchievementManager::load("achievements.dat");
```
